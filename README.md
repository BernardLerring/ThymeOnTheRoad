# ThymeOnTheRoad

## Thyme On The Road Website

This is the main website for the recipe site Thyme On The Road. This website was inspired by mine and my wife's travels, and our cooking whilst we were on our adventures. Cooking in a hostel, tent or camper van doesn't have to be boring or unhealthy!

## User Experience

### Site Aims

![Flow Diagram of User Experience](/readme_images/flowchart.png "User Experience")

### User Stories

![User Stories](/readme_images/userstories.png "User Stories")

### First time user goals

- First time users should be able to easily navigate the site and view the content on any device.

- First time users want the site to only show a certain number of recipes on the front page so as not to overwhelm.

- First time users should be able to view recipes, and follow the methods to cook them for themselves.

- First time users should be able to view the recipe in more detail

- First time users should be able to sign up to the site and create an account.

- First time users should be able to follow the social media links to find out more about the website owners and it's legitimacy.

### Returning user goals:

- As a returning user I want to be able to like and comment on recipes.

### Frequent user goals:

- I would like to see regular new recipes from the admin team.

- I want to see only comments that are appropriate for a recipe website.

## Design

### Colour scheme:

The main colours used are pastel shades of orange, green, red and brown. THese are coupled with a beige that serves as the light background for much of the site. It gives the site a more organic feel than clinical bright colours. I found the palette for this at [ColorsWall] (https://colorswall.com/palette/31431).

![Color Palette](/readme_images/colourpalette.png "Coler Palette")

### Fonts/Typography:

The main font used across the whole site is Merienda. It fits well with the colour scheme, and again, is less clinical than some more modern looking typefaces. It's fallback font is Sans Serif.

### Images:

Being a recipe website, images of the food are important. However, as lots of the recipes were created "on the road", it wasn't always possible to take good photos of them. Instead, I have chosen to use artists (my wifes) interpretations of what the food looked like.

## Features

- Responsive on a variety of devices.

- Regularly updated content.

- Commenting and liking features for signed up users.

- Admin features for the site oweners to approve comments, and add content.

### Header/Navigation

- Logo/site title is in the top left of the screen. Pressing on it will link you back to the top of the homepage.

- To the right of the bar is the remaining navigation links. Home, Register and Login. Once the user is logged in, this changes to Home and Logout. On smaller devices, the navbar drops down to a hamburger menu for better user experience on mobile. 

- The background colour, and the font colours chosen stand out well making it easy for the user to see where they are and what they are doing.

- The navigation makes it clear to the user what can be accessed on the site.

![Header and Navigation](/readme_images/navbar.png "Header/Navbar")

### Recipes

- The recipes load 6 to a page, with pagination to allow users to move to "next" and "previous" pages once 6 has been reached.

![Recipes](/readme_images/recipesmain.png "Recipes")

- When a recipe is clicked on you get the recipe detail, including the ability to comment and like a recipe (if registered/signed in)

![Recipe Detail](/readme_images/recipedetail.png "Recipe Detail")

### Pagination

- The pagination buttons appear when 6 recipes have loaded on one page allowing users to click to forward to the next set of recipes, or back to the previous.

![Next Button](/readme_images/nextbutton.png "Next Button") ![Previous Button](/readme_images/previousbutton.png "Previous Button")

### Footer

- This links the user to the 4 main social media accounts for the community.

- This allows them to confirm the legitimacy of the site, whilst also joining the social media followings.

- The footer colours mirror the header, with the FontAwesome icons changing colour when hovered over to indicate to the user that they can be pressed. They also change to a different colour to show the user when they have been active.

## Creation and Deployment

The site was created in Django using the following steps:

1. In the terminal window, of the CI template, install Django and gunicorn using the command "pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn"

2. Install supporting libraries using the command "pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2"

3. Install Cloudinary to store image files using the command "pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage"

4. Create a requirements.txt file using the command "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt"

5. Create the project and give it a name using the command "django-admin startproject PROJ_NAME ." The . is important!!

6. Create the app and name it using the command "python3 manage.py startapp APP_NAME"

7. in your settings.py file, add to the installed apps section: 

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    …
    'APP_NAME',
]

8. Save your file

9. Back in the terminal window, migrate your changes using the command "python3 manage.py makemigrations" followed by "python3 manage.py migrate"

10. Run the server to test that your app had built using the command "python3 manage.py runserver"

To deploy the app to Heroku, use the following steps:

1. Sign up to Heroku

2. Click on the "create new app" button.

3. Create a new app with the format "APP_NAME". Don't forget to pick your location as Europe.

4. Add a database to app resources by clicking on the resources tab on your app dashboard and search for and add "Heroku PostGres".

5. Copy the DATABASE_URL value into your config vars section located under the settings tab in your app dashboard byt clicking "Reveal Config Vars".

6. Back in gitpod, create a new env.py file in the top level directory.

7. Inside the env.py file, import os library byt writing "import os" at the top of your code.

8. Set environment variables using the following syntax: os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in Heroku DATABASE_URL Link"

9. Add in a secret key using the following syntax: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"

10. Back in your heroku dashboard, add the secret key to your config vars by using "SECRET_KEY, “randomSecretKey”" and giving your secret key a set of numbers for a value.

11. Back in settings.py, reference env.py using the following syntax: 

from pathlib import Path
import os
import dj_database_url

if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
   import env

12. Remove the insecure secret key and replace with the secret key from Heroku. 

SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

13. Comment out the old DataBases Section.

14. Add in a new databases section using: 

DATABASES = {
   'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}

15. Back in the terminal window, make your migrations again using the "python3 manage.py migrate" command

16. In the Cloudinary app that you have been signed into, copy the URL you have been given from the Cloudinary dashboard.

17. Back in env.py, add it using the following syntax: os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"

18. In Heroku, add the Cloudinary URL to config vars in the settings tab. 

19. Add "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC" to the Heroku config vars. This will be removed before final deployment.

20. In settings.py, add the Cloudinary libraries to installed apps: 

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    …,
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary',
    …,
]

The order in which these are written is important.

21. Tell Django to use Cloudinary to store media and static files
Place under the Static files Note: STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'

22. Link your fiule to the templates directory in Heroku. Place it under the BASE_DIR line. 

TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')

23. Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR and place within the TEMPLATES array. 

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        …,
        'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
       …,
            ],
        },
    },
]

24. Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: 

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["PROJ_NAME.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]

25. Back in GitPod create 3 new folders at the top level directory for Media, Static and Templates.

26. Create a procfile on the top level directory. 

27. In you procfile, add the following code: web: gunicorn PROJ_NAME.wsgi

28. Back in the GitPod terminal window, Add, Commit and Push your code. 

git add .
git commit -m “Deployment Commit”
git push

29. Back in Heroku, deploy the content manually through Heroku by using GitHub as the main deployment method on the main branch.

30. Once you have then built your app, styled it, and written all code, go back to Heroku and click on "Deploy Branch"

31. The build will happen in front of you, and once it has successfully built your app, you can click on "Open App" to take you to your live site.

### Future Development Opportunities

## User Focused

- A form could be added so that users can submit their own recipes in the same format as the site, for future addition to the site with admin approval.

- The site could have further sections for types of cuisine, time taken to cook recipes so users could make a simpler journey round the site to choose what/how they want to cook.

- Videos could be added to each recipe of the cooking method.

- Clicking on the "Recipes from time spent travelling and cooking" could link to an "About" section with info about the site oweners.
